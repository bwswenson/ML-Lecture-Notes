\chapter{Calculus and Analysis For Machine Learning}

Possible sections:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Some basic calculus results (MVT, extreme value theorem, etc.) 
  \item Fundamental theorem of calculus (then, implications? Like, how is this useful for...)
  \item Inverse and implicit function theorems (and implications) 
  \item Divergence theorem (and relationship to fundamental theorem of calculus)
  \item Stokes theorem? (Does this apply to higher than $\R^3$?) 
  \item integration by parts (and some implications. Like for ML?) 
  \item Multivariable chain rule
  \item Change of variables theorem
\end{itemize}
